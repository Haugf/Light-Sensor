# Light-Sensor

## Objective
For the Particle.io Electron to read light values from the photoresistor and send that information to a firebase database. From ther I use the Javascript p5.js library to read the values and display the stream of data in a visually pleasing UI!

## Disclaimer
This code is all based off of the work of John Kuiphoff!!
After about 4 hours I was able to recreate his video with any updates to all systems in 2019.
Here is a link to the original video if you would like to recreate the project too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puBpA1LmGCs
